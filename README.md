# Frontend Masters Course

A collection of animation and interaction experiments for learning.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the experiments.

## Using the Experiments

Each experiment has a `starter` and `solution` version:

- **Starter**: Your starting point to implement the exercise
- **Solution**: The completed implementation for reference

To switch between versions, edit the experiment's `page.tsx` file and change the import from `starter` to `solution` (or vice versa).
